# hello-world
Just a repository
I love to go camping, boating,fishing and i love playing with my baby cousins. I was originally going for my RN but i couldn't deal with the blood and the needles so I decided to do computer software development.
I had to come to school today instead of staying home and helping my mom and grandparents with my baby cousins.
